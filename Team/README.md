# Team Directory

Welcome to the team directory! This folder contains profiles for your organization's team members.

## Team Roster

Add your team members here as you create their profiles.

| Name | Role | Profile |
|------|------|---------|
| Example Person | Example Role | [[Example-Person]] |

## Quick Links

- [[Roles]] - Roles and responsibilities matrix
- [[../Database/README|Database]] - View team task assignments and CRM
- [[../Projects/README|Projects]] - Active projects

## Communication

Configure your team's communication channels:
- Primary: Your team chat platform
- Repository: GitHub or your version control

## Working with Team Profiles

### For Team Members
- Keep your profile updated
- Add current projects and focus areas
- Update availability and contact info

### For Agents
- Link to team profiles using `[[Team/Name]]` format (e.g., `[[Team/Alice-Smith]]`)
- For CRM and task assignment, use `[[Database/People/Name]]` format
- Always use full names: `[[Team/Alice Smith]]` not "Alice"
- Check profiles for current responsibilities when assigning tasks
- Update profiles when team members join/leave projects

## Team vs Database/People

- **Team/** - Team member profiles and bios
- **Database/People/** - CRM entries for task assignment and relationships

For internal team members, create entries in both locations.
