# Documents

Research and documentation for your organization.

## Overview

The Documents folder is for storing in-depth research, documentation, and knowledge. Organize it however makes sense for your team - by topic, project, or domain.

## Example Structure

```
Documents/
├── Research/           # Research notes and findings
├── Technical/          # Technical documentation
├── Business/           # Business documentation
└── References/         # Reference materials
```
