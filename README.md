# Jarvis Knowledge Base Template

Welcome to your Jarvis-powered knowledge base!

## What is Jarvis?

This is a template workspace for Jarvis - an AI agent assistant that helps you manage tasks, projects, and knowledge. This workspace is designed to be stored in `~/jarvis` and integrates with Obsidian for a beautiful user interface.

## Why This Workspace?

This workspace provides:

- **Portable & Standard** - Just markdown files in git
- **User Friendly** - Beautiful view using Obsidian
- **Agent Friendly** - Claude Code can easily modify files, push to Github, and sync with your team
